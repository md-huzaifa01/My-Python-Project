# ⚡ Electricity Bill Calculator – Bangladesh Unit-Based System

This project calculates electricity bills in Bangladeshi Taka (৳) and converts the final bill amount to USD ($), based on the unit of electricity used. 
It simulates a simplified version of the Bangladeshi electricity billing system with various conditions and charges applied based on unit thresholds.

## 🔢 How the Calculation Works

The billing is based on a tiered system:

### 1. **Units ≤ 50**
- Charged at **৳25 per unit**.
- No meter fee or extra charges applied.

### 2. **Units ≤ 100**
- First 50 units ignored.
- Remaining units (i.e., `units - 50`) charged at **৳3.50 per unit**.
- **Meter Fee**: ৳150  
- Additional Charge: ৳50

### 3. **Units = 200
- First 100 units ignored.
- Remaining units (i.e., `units - 100`) charged at **৳3.00 per unit**.
- Additional Charges:
  - Meter Fee: ৳75
  - Extra Fee: ৳162.50

### 4. **Units > 200**
- First 200 units ignored.
- Remaining units (i.e., `units - 200`) charged at **৳5.00 per unit**.
- Additional Charges:
  - Meter Fee: ৳150
  - Fee 1: ৳162.50
  - **Bangladeshi System Base Fee**: ৳526
  - Final Charge: ৳100

### 🔁 Currency Conversion
At the end, the total amount in Bangladeshi Taka is converted to USD based on a predefined exchange rate (you can customize this in the code).

## 🧮 Example Calculation

For example, if the units used are:

- `45` → 45 × 25 = ৳1125 → Converted to USD
- `100` → (100 - 50) × 3.5 + 150 + 50 = ৳375 + 200 = ৳575 → Converted to USD
- `200` → (200 - 100) × 3.0 + 75 + 162.5 = ৳300 + 237.5 = ৳537.5 → Converted to USD
- `250` → (250 - 200) × 5.0 + 150 + 162.5 + 526 + 100 = ৳250 + 938.5 = ৳1188.5 → Converted to USD
